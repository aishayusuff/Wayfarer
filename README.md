# Wayfarer
A simple site for travellers built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript

#RE: UPDATES
I am currently working on improving the mobile responsiveness of this project and also implementing modularization in the JavaScript.

# Some JS functionalities Present (To be Updated)
. **Menu fade**: when you hover over one menu link, all items in the header greys out, and if you hover over any menu in the footer, others fade out too (reduced opacity).

. **Scroll to section**: The button in the header of the page scrolls the first section of the page into view.

. **Tabbed componnents**: Clicking on each tab in the first section changes the content displayed. Each clicked tab is transformed in the Y axis on click.

. **Slider**: Clicking on the **left** and **right** arrows in this section, as well as pressing the **left** and **right** arrow keys moves through the slides.
